The results have a high R squared value of 81.89% suggesting there is a statistically reliable relationship between points scored and the time a player is on the court. As shown in the scatter plot to the right the amount of time a player spends on the court is fairly closely related to the number of points they may score in an NBA season. ,,,,,,,,
